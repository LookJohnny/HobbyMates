HobbyMates
HobbyMates is a Node.js application that integrates with a Python NLP script to match skills between users. This application is designed to help users find matches based on their provided and required skills, leveraging the power of advanced NLP techniques to understand and compare textual data.

Features
Skill Matching: Compares a user's required skill with a database of provided skills to find the best matches.
NLP Integration: Uses SpaCy and NLTK in Python to process and compare text data for accurate skill matching.
Flexible API: Offers a RESTful API endpoint for matching skills, making it easy to integrate with front-end applications or other services.
Requirements
Node.js
Python 3
SpaCy with en_core_web_md model
NLTK with omw-1.4 dataset
Installation
Clone the repository:
`git clone https://example.com/SkillMatcher.git
cd SkillMatcher`
Install Node.js dependencies:

`npm install`
Set up the Python environment and install dependencies:

`python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install spacy nltk
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
python -m nltk.downloader omw-1.4`
Usage
Start the Node.js server:

`node index.js
The API is now accessible at http://localhost:3000.`

To match skills, send a POST request to /match-skills with JSON payload containing skillRequire and skillsProvide:

`{
  "skillRequire": "driving",
  "skillsProvide": ["football", "write", "body building", "game", "chess", "racing"]
}`
Development
The main Node.js application is located in index.js.
Skill matching logic is implemented in the BERT.py Python script.
Modify the userRoutes.js file to add or update the RESTful API endpoints.
