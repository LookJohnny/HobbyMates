HobbyMates

HobbyMates is a Node.js application that integrates with a Python NLP script to match skills between users. This application is designed to help users find matches based on their provided and required skills, leveraging the power of advanced NLP techniques to understand and compare textual data.


The main Node.js application is located in index.js. Skill matching logic is implemented in the BERT.py Python script. Modify the userRoutes.js file to add or update the RESTful API endpoints. Contributing Contributions to SkillMatcher are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Features

- Skill Matching: Compares a user's required skill with a database of provided skills to find the best matches. 
- NLP - Integration: Uses SpaCy and NLTK in Python to process and compare text data for accurate skill matching. 
- Flexible API: Offers a RESTful API endpoint for matching skills, making it easy to integrate with front-end applications or other services.
